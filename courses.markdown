## Undergrad

My undergrad at CMU consisted of a great mixture of classes. When I was first starting out at CMU, I wasn't sure what I wanted to specialize in because I was interested in several areas.

My competitive programming and math competition experiences from high school pointed me towards theoretical computer science and working towards an additional math major, so I took several classes in these areas. I had a peculiar interest in computer generated music, so I sampled some classes from the music department, but ultimately decided I was more interested in theoretical CS. On top of a ridiculous workload in these early years of undergrad, I was also very busy figuring myself out as a person, resolving my depression and anxiety, and growing up into the responsible adult I am today.

Around the end of sophomore year, I realized I loved the areas of logic and formal verification even more than theoretical computer science. I had already completed the bulk of my graduation requirements, so from then on, I dedicated as many courses as I could towards these areas specifically.

My senior year was a "mock phd" year where I stopped taking as many classes and focused primarily on research, although still completing the remaining graduation requirements I needed. What was originally planned as an additional math major track thinned down to a math minor which thinned down even more into a philosophy minor, giving me greater freedom to dedicate myself to the programming language field through independent research. The work was exceedingly brutal, especially due to covid making everything worse, but I am really proud to have been accepted to a PhD at CMU.
