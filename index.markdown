Hobbies
-------
I love watching anime and am involved in anime-like clubs like cosplay. I attend various anime conventions

I am a gamer. I like rhythm games (Pump it Up, Dance Dance Revolution, and BeatSaber for example), VR games, puzzle games, and platformers

I also like doing exercise that increases coordination and dexterity. I have been doing parkour for three years and I've sampled other similar activities
